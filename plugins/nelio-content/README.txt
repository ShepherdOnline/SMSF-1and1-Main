= Reasons for choosing Nelio =

Take a look at the top 5 reasons for choosing Nelio Content:

= #1. Editorial Calendar—All You Need, at a Glance =

The Editorial Calendar is one of the most powerful tools included in Nelio Content. It offers a unified view of absolutely all your content (that is, posts, social messages, and tasks). It's also the easiest way to create new content and reschedule your posts and social messages, simply by dragging-and-dropping them.

= #2. Social Networks—The Sky’s the Limit =

Once you've finished writing a post, there's still a lot of work to do. You know that its success doesn't depend on its quality only—you have to make sure it gets the promotion it deserves, so that it can reach as many people as possible. That's why Nelio Content includes social messages.

Nelio Content adds a new box in the post editing page named Social Media. There, you'll find a timeline where you can schedule social messages aimed at promoting your content in social networks. These messages can be scheduled based on the publication date of your post, so none of them will be shared until you publish the post itself.

There's no need to open multiple social networks and share your messages manually on each website. And you won't need to use external apps to schedule messages either. Nelio Content integrates social message creation within WordPress, so that you can create them at the same time you create your posts. Don't waste your time looking for titles or permalinks—Nelio takes care of this for you!

= #3. Content Assistant—We Take Care of the Details =

Tagging content properly, using images to illustrate your ideas, linking old posts in your blog to build a strong internal link structure, or linking to other blogs to offer different views on a subject are all examples of how you can create beautiful content. But keeping them all in mind is not an easy task.

Nelio Content analyzes the quality of your posts while you create them. With Nelio's quality check in the Publish box, you'll have an easy-to-understand summary of all the things you should address before publishing the post. But, hey, they're only suggestions! It's up to you whether you honor them or not.

= #4. Teams—You'll Never Work Alone =

WordPress is a multi-user CMS. Surprisingly, there's plenty of plugins that ignore this and assume you run your WordPress blog all by yourself. But not Nelio's. We created a plugin that takes into account the fact that you and your team work together to create something big. Nelio Content's able to work with all your team, offering the right tools to each profile at each moment.

= #5. Advanced Functionalities—There's More than You Think =

Nelio Content includes a ton of beautiful features aimed at making your life easier. Suggested references, editorial comments, tasks, external featured images... download the plugin and discover them all!

* **Bug Fix**. Editing an already-existing social message in calendar now loads the appropriate preview.

* **Bug Fix**. Changes in your subscription (under the _Account_ screen) does no longer return a 401 error.
* **Improvement**. External featured images inserted using `(get_)the_post_thumbnail` now take into account all this function's params.
* **Improvement**. Pagefrog does no longer break our plugin in custom post types.

= 1.1.4 (November 24, 2016) =
* **Bug Fix**. Editing a post from the _Calendar_ or using _Quick Edit_ in _All Posts_ screen removed the featured image of said post. This is now fixed.

= 1.1.3 (November 23, 2016) =
* **Bug Fix**. Pages couldn't be edited with version 1.1.1 and 1.1.2 due to an unexpected error. This has now been fixed.

= 1.1.2 (November 22, 2016) =
* **Bug Fix**. Sometimes, the post analysis reported that there was a featured image set, even if none was actually set. This has now been fixed.
* **Improvement**. Post analysis now takes into account whether the analyzed post type supports featured image and, if they're not supported, the plugin doesn't check whether the post includes one or not (it simply doesn't make sense). Similarly, tags are only checked if the analyzed post is a WordPress regular _Post_.
* **Improvement**. Tiny UI modifications in Connected Social Profiles screen.

= 1.1.1 (November 18, 2016) =
* **New Feature**. [Nelio External Featured Image](https://wordpress.org/plugins/external-featured-image/) has been re-implemented using a new engine and merged into Nelio Content. Now, you can insert Featured Images using external URLs with just a couple of clicks. It works with virtually all themes, including Newspaper, Newsmag, and Enfold, among others.
* **New Feature**. Use one of the images in the post as the featured image. This feature uses the improved external featured image engine, so that the image in the post is properly scaled and cropped when used as featured image.
* **Bug Fix**. The button for Re-Authenticating social profiles is working properly. In previous versions, the profile wasn't reauthenticated&mdash;a new profile was registered instead.
* **Bug Fix**. Social message preview for drafts now shows the post card properly in Twitter, Facebook, and so on.

= 1.1.0 (November 10, 2016) =
* **New Feature**. You can now use custom post types in the calendar! Manage your regular posts and/or custom post types from Nelio's editorial calendar and save time.
* **Improvement**. Social message preview now matches Twitter new styles (e.g. last link is hidden and only shown as a "preview card").
* **Improvement**. During installation, we now detect if the server supports SNI and, if it doesn't, we access Nelio Content's API using a secure proxy.
* **Improvement**. Select2 components are now internationalized.
* **Bug Fix**. Sometimes, Nelio's post analysis didn't analyze post length or links properly. This was supposed to be fixed in the previous version, but it wasn't. Hopefully, it is now.

= 1.0.5 (September 29, 2016) =
* **Testing Environment**. We've included a test suite in development for testing the plugin. Notice the test suite is not included in releases/tags.
* **Bug Fix**. If the post doesn't have an excerpt, the post quality analysis detects it properly and warns the user about this situation.
* **Bug Fix**. Sometimes, Nelio's post analysis didn't analyze post length or links properly. This has now been fixed.
* **Improvement**. We've extended our code base so that we can overcome some issues generated by other plugins. In this release, we added a snippet of code for [fixing these issues generated by Pagefrog](https://neliosoftware.com/blog/when-wordpress-freedom-kills-your-business/).
* **Improvement**. Previous versions of Nelio Content loaded all author users in a JavaScript object. Usually, this works perfectly fine, but on some installations with tons of "author users", page load times might be slower. We now modified this behavior so that author users are loaded "on demand", offering a more responsive UX.
* **Improvement**. Post editor dialog in calendar page has now been slightly redesigned. From now on, users can open/preview any given post from the calendar itself (there's a new action button for that).
* **Minor Improvement**. An author with the admin role now triggers a "soft warning" (orange) in the post analysis section.
* **Minor Improvement**. In a multisite installation, you can now jump to the calendar of each individual blog directly using "My Sites" in admin bar.
* **Minor Improvement**. After accepting Nelio Content's terms and conditions, new users are automatically redirected to the calendar page (instead of the account page).
* **Minor Improvement**. Refactored some portions of our code.


= 1.0.4 (September 6, 2016) =
* **Improvement**. When loading the current month in the calendar, the UI now smoothly scrolls to "today" using an animation.
* **Improvement**. First-time post analysis (right after loading the page for editing a post) is faster.
* **Improvement**. Posts without a publication date triggered a JavaScript warning. This has now been fixed and MomentJS does no longer complain.
* **Bug Fix**. Sometimes, suggested references included in a post weren't marked as such unless the user changed the post content. This has now been fixed.
* **Bug Fix**. Now, you can only add new items on future dates and today. Before the fix, you could add items on any date whose month and day was past the current date, regardless of the year (which was clearly wrong).
* **Bug Fix**. Calendar does no longer "auto-scroll" up (or down) after dragging an element around and dropping it in the top (or bottom) shadow.

= 1.0.3 (August 10, 2016) =
* **Improvement**. Shortcut to Nelio's Calendar in top admin bar, under site menu.
* **Improvement**. Social message previews highlight hashtags and mentions properly, using a library from Twitter: `twitter-text` ([see it on GitHub](https://github.com/twitter/twitter-text/)).
* **Improvement**. If your social message has multiple lines, you\'ll see them on the preview.
* **Improvement**. Default profile pictures show the first letter of the user.
* **Bug Fix**. When adding images to Twitter messages, char count didn't match Twitter's char count. As a result, some messages couldn't be shared. This has now been fixed.
* **Bug Fix**. Given a scheduled social message that's related to a published post, it can now be rescheduled in the calendar (it wasn't possible in previous versions).
* **Minor Tweaks**. A few animations and icons have been polished.

= 1.0.2 (August 2, 2016) =
* **UI Improvement**. A few dialogs are now bigger, so that internationalized titles and texts can fit in.
* **Translators & i18n**. A few more changes in our string contexts and comments, so that translators can translate the plugin easily.

= 1.0.1 (July 27, 2016) =
* **Bug Fix**. Post analysis summary and finer details now match. That is, if the post quality analysis is all green, then Nelio Content reports: _The post looks awesome!_
* **Bug Fix**. Number of words in post is properly counted when using the Text editor.
* **Bug Fix**. Internal relative links are properly managed by the post analysis. Thus, including links such as `/some-page` or `#name` work fine.
* **Translators & i18n**. Some string contexts have been changed from `user` to `text`. Hopefully, they're more consistent now.

= 1.0.0 (July 25, 2016) =
* **First Release**. This is the first release of our plugin.
